The information book will first begin with team introductions then discuss a general introduction into the current production/generation of artificial intelligence. After these introductions, we will transition into the main section of the book, discussing several areas of ethical concern as it relates to As artificial intelligence (AI) continues its integration into various facets of society, it becomes imperative to critically assess the ethical implications surrounding its development and usage. This website serves as a learning tool for the Ross community to explore key ethical considerations in the AI landscape, with a focus on large language models. Before jumping into content, we will introduce the team that put this resource together for your education purposes. At its core, this resource aims to unpack pressing ethical issues in AI advancement. We will begin by analyzing the substantial infrastructure and resources needed to create increasingly complex AI models and assessing environmental and financial costs. Moving forward, we will discuss crucial data-related factors, including unauthorized scraping and ingrained biases. Additionally, this website will address inherent challenges in training ethical, safe AI systems. It will also stress the importance of responsible data handling and privacy measures taken by AI companies. Risks of misalignment between AI and human values will similarly be explored. To conclude, we will overview two domains - personalized AI and open-source projects - that underscore AIâ€™s societal benefits despite its problems. Overall, we hope to spur thoughtful discussion about establishing ethical frameworks to guide AI progress in a way that prioritizes privacy, ensures security, and promotes human-centric values. This introduction sets the stage for an examination of AI ethics tailored to the Ross community. "]]
